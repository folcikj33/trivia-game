# Trivia-game

### This is Trivia-game that mixes a little bit of Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire nerd fandom in with what is mostly silly gaffs and nonsensical baffoonery inspired by infmaous Impossible Quiz by slap-me-do. 

## Rules 

1. The "game" begins with an opening title that entices the casual passerby with a clickable button. "Click here to start," the button says.

2. Once they click, the first multiple-choice question of ten pops up, and the timer starts counting backwards from 30.

3. If the user guesses right, they get a "fanfare" page that lasts exactly 5 seconds. They get a point. If they guess wrong, they get a "consolation"page that also lasts five seconds. In either case, they can't hit "next" and have to watch and wait fro the next question.

4. Each successive question in produced in random order, then discarded after use, so no question is repeated in one game. All the questions should be played once and only once in a given game, and returned for the next game. 

5. When the 30 second timer equals zero, it's counted as a loss, and the user is taken to the consolation page. 

6. When it's all said and done, a final screen shows how much the user got right total. Though what exactly they have won may seem unclear.

(*all are correct answers are consisstent and grounded in asoiaf lore*)
